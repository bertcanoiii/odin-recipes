  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Do you remember that time a certain president was caught not having any idea what a gallon of milk cost? Sometimes that's me. When I'm shopping for ingredients for a video, I'm usually so engrossed in the what and the how that I don't pay much attention to the how much? Plus, I get to use a company credit card, which also adds to my oblivion. So, when I notice prices are high, we have a problem, and beef prices are high.
  </p>
  <p>That was the main motivation for this beefless meatloaf, which I'd encourage you to make no matter what actual meat costs, since this really was delicious, especially next to some mashed potatoes and gravy. Besides being super savory, and very tasty, it's arguably better for you nutritionally, and if you're one of these people who wants your grandkids to inherit a livable planet, it's probably better on that front as well.
  </p>
  <p>The secret here, besides sneaking in a couple spoons of good beef base, is to make sure you cook your mushrooms until they are very well caramelized. This significantly ups the "meatiness," not to mention it gives your loaf a nice browned beef-like color. It's amazing how much getting this to look and feel like meatloaf adds to the experience. Anyway, like I joked about in the video, you'll be the judge of whether this is indeed "better than beef," but it is cheaper, which is just one of the reasons I hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!

    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>1 cup cooked black lentils</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    <li>2/3 cup rolled oats</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Glaze:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Very generously grease a loaf pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add mushrooms and 1 teaspoon kosher salt and saut√© until nicely browned and juices have evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in onion and cook until soft, another 5 to 7 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add celery, tomato paste, and beef base; cook and stir until tomato paste begins to toast on the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes. Stir in water and turn off the heat; let sit for about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>
      Transfer mushroom mixture into a food processor. Add cooked lentils and pulse until finely chopped but not pureed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transfer to a mixing bowl and add eggs, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, oregano, thyme, cayenne, ketchup, bread crumbs, oats, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Mix until thoroughly combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transfer mixture into the prepared loaf pan, then wrap with foil and place on a sheet pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the center of the preheated oven until firm to the touch, about 1 hour.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove the loaf from the oven and place on a wire rack. Remove the foil and place it on the baking sheet. Grease the foil with 2 teaspoons olive oil. Let the loaf sit for 10 to 15 minutes, and increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>
      While the loaf is resting, make the glaze: Whisk ketchup, Dijon mustard, and brown sugar together in a small bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Invert the loaf onto the foil and spread glaze all over the surface, mostly on the top but some on the sides.
    </li>
    <li>
      Return to the oven and bake until the glaze is cooked on, 15 to 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Carefully transfer the loaf onto a cutting board. Cut into 6 slices and serve.
    </li>
  </ol>
